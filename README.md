## Introduction

The recent catastrophe in Tenerife in August 2023 underscores the urgent need to employ advanced techniques for the monitoring and study of forest fires. On August 15, 2023, a devastating forest fire broke out in Tenerife, Canary Islands, driven by factors such as wind, heat, and low humidity levels. This tragedy prompted massive evacuations, extensive damage to the island's flora and fauna, and impacts on essential supplies. It is considered one of the most destructive fires in recent decades in Spain, affecting multiple municipalities on the island.

In this context, remote sensing emerges as a crucial tool. This technique involves acquiring information about an object or phenomenon without direct contact, typically using sensors aboard satellites or aircraft. The ESA's Copernicus program is a flagship initiative of the European Union for Earth observation and monitoring. It consists of a family of satellites (the Sentinels) and their associated data, which provide detailed images of our planet and help scientists and public policies understand and respond to environmental changes.

Through the Sentinel-2 satellite from the Copernicus program, there is an aim to develop a severity index for forest fires
